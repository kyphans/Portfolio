## 4. Features and Requirements

### 4.1 Core Functional Requirements

#### 4.1.1 Static Pages
- **Homepage**: Overview of the developer’s expertise, recent projects, and contact information.
- **About Page**: Detailed description of the developer’s background, skills, and experience.
- **Projects Page**: List of notable projects with descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos or repositories.
- **Contact Page**: Contact form for inquiries, along with social media links and resume download option.

#### 4.1.2 Dynamic Content
- **Blog/Articles Page**: Display articles or posts by the developer. Content should be fetched dynamically (e.g., from a CMS like Sanity).
- **Project Details Pages**: Dynamic route pages for each project, rendering detailed project information based on data fetched from an API or CMS.

#### 4.1.3 User Experience Enhancements
- **Dark Mode**: Theme toggle to switch between light and dark modes.
- **Lazy Loading for Images and Content**: Use Next.js’s optimized image component for faster loading and reduced initial page weight.

### 4.2 Technical Requirements
